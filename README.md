# StabiliTeeth
A self-balancing toothbrush for people suffering from Parkinson's disease

## Setup

### Development Environment
 1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
 2. Download the [I2Cdev library](https://codeload.github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/zip/master)
 3. Extract the folders `i2cdevlib-master\Arduino\MPU6050` and `i2cdevlib-master\Arduino\I2Cdev` to a temp location
 4. Move the 2 folders to the Arduino libraries location - probably `C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries`
 5. If this is done correctly, there should be an entry named "MPU6050" under File -> Examples

### 3D Processing (optional)
 1. Download and extract the [Processing software](https://processing.org/download/?processing)
 2. Download the [ToxicLibs complete zip](https://bitbucket.org/postspectacular/toxiclibs/downloads/)
 3. Extract the zip contents to the libraries folder in the processing sketchbook - for me this was found at `C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Processing\libraries`
